            <p>
                This website is a place for students to experiment with working in git.
                You are expected to submit a pull request to this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your change should be small and should follow these rules.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You should add a <code>&lt;section id="P987654321"&gt;</code> element inside the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element, with the <code>id</code> attribute set to <strong>your student number</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The element should be visible, with sensible content indicating that you have indeed been here.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you can't think of anything, just add your student number as content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should style the element and its contents in some way by adding at least one ruleset to the CSS file like <code>#P987654321 {}</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should <strong>not</strong> change the HTML in the <em>rules</em> section which contains these rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should <strong>not</strong> edit anyone else's content from the project.
                </li>
            </ol>

                This one is trying to be clever with a grid layout.
                I think its quite a successful experiment but I'm sure someone will come up with something nicer.
